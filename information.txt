# Custom printed t-shirts

Perfect, honeybun 🐻💖 let’s make this list clean and pro so your customers (or lecturer 👀✨) can skim through easily. I’ll group them into **Neckline**, **Sleeve**, **Fit/Length**, and **Function/Fabric**. Each one will get a tiny one-liner description so it’s quick to digest 🌸

### 👕 Neckline Styles

* **Crew Neck** – Classic round neckline, the most common everyday t-shirt.
* **V-Neck** – Neckline dips into a "V" shape, giving a sharper, slimming look.
* **Scoop Neck** – A wider, deeper round neckline for a softer style.
* **Henley** – A crew neck with a short button placket, casual yet stylish.
* **Polo** – Features a collar and buttoned placket, often seen as smart-casual.
* **Mock Neck** – Short, slightly raised collar similar to a turtleneck.
* **Muslimah** – Modest t-shirt with a longer cut and higher neckline.
